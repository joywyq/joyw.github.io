		<h2>Hey there! I'm Joy, and I'm really happy that you're here reading this.
			<br><br> I'm a Singaporean, and I've been living in all its sweltering heat for the past 20 years. In my middle school and high school years I went to School of the Arts, Singapore, which taught the International Baccalaureate program but added on a whole lot of culture and perspective in terms of art-making.
			<br><br> Now I'm a penultimate year student studying Psychology and Linguistics at the University of Oxford, and also the designer for the Oxford Artificial Intelligence Society (they're are a really awesome bunch of people - not robots). The part I love the most about being here is that I can surround myself with people who are deeply passionate in their fields and from whom I can learn. I'm very much interested in working in a cognitive science-related field in the future, whether that's in the form of research or UX design.
			<br><br>I'm the kind of person who likes reading up about something cool online, throwing myself at a project or community to be a part of it, realising that it's more work than expected, and trying to do them anyway. Thankfully, its led to many really great results. Over the last summer I was doing an internship at Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) where I was brought onboard as a user researcher, which quickly turned into a UX design project, and I hadn't even heard of UX beforehand. Before I entered university I was an English tuition teacher, a cook at a French restaurant, and a social worker/research assistant. I've been trying to learn how to code, and evidently from this website I'm not very good yet. But I'm trying! 
			<br><br>I'm always up for a conversation. Get in touch with me at <a href="joywyq18@gmail.com">joywyq18@gmail.com</a> and I will talk to you about psychometrics, typography, neural networks, arts education, recipes, film, good science, Queen, and anything you're passionate about.
